# Loan
Default Rate Prediction and Analysis
In this project I have to put ourself in the shoes of a loan issuer and manage credit risk by using the past data and deciding whom to give the loan to in the future. The text files contain complete loan data for all loans issued by XYZ Corp. through 2007-2015. The data contains the indicator of default, payment information, credit history, etc.

Objective : To build a data model to predict the probability of default, and choose a cut-off based on what you feel is suitable. Alternatively you can also use a modelling technique which gives binary output. Based on the data that is available during loan application, build a model to predict default in the future. This will help the company in deciding whether or not to pass the loan. Also note that the data contains defaulters, successful payers and customers who were current during that time. To simplify the problem, customers under 'current' status have been considered as non-defaulters in the dataset.
